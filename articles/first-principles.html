    I've spent my career chasing signals: sound waves, brain waves, neural networks. The common thread isn't any one field; it's the question "what if?" followed by "let's find out."
  </p>
  
  
    <h2>The Thread</h2>
    <p>
      If you trace my professional timeline, you won't find a standard ladder. You'll find a continuous thread: analyzing complex signals to understand human potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started as a sound engineer and musician. Then neuroscience pulled me in, and I spent years at MIT modeling the biological hardware of human intelligence: how the brain processes emotion, movement, and reward. I understand the human side of the equation biologically, not just philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      That foundation matters. To work at the intersection of humanity and AI, I believe you need to understand the fundamental architecture of humanity itself.
    </p>

    "I translate between humans and emerging technology. Not because the tech is interesting (though it is), but because the humans are."
  
  
  
    <h2>High Stakes, High Impact</h2>
    <p>
      At a major academic medical center, I'm navigating some of the highest stakes in AI deployment: integrating generative AI into clinical oncology workflows. I've also built ambient assessment systems for K-12 education. In both cases, the goal isn't replacement; it's augmentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know how to deploy AI where it matters most, and where the consequences of getting it wrong are unacceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, I've learned to build alignment across skeptical stakeholders: clinicians, administrators, IT teams, patients, students, teachers. Each with different risk tolerances and vocabularies. That's coalition work. It's also the core skill of anyone trying to bring emerging technology into complex human systems.
    </p>
  
  
  
    <h2>The Creative Root</h2>
    <p>
      Before I was a scientist, I was a sound engineer and musician. That's not just background; it's foundational. I understand that technology must ultimately serve human expression. This ensures I approach AI not as a mechanistic tool, but as a medium that must resonate with lived experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father had no formal education past high school, but he had a superpower: he could connect with anyone. He'd naturally morph his cadence to match whoever he was talking to. People responded. He made it look easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned from him that the best technology, like the best communication, meets people where they are.
    </p>
  
  
  <div class="pullquote">
    "First principles over best practices. Compasses over maps."
  
  
  
    <h2>What I Believe</h2>
    <p>
      The playbook for leading AI-driven organizations is being written right now. We're moving from a world of deterministic rules to one of irreducible ambiguity. This demands a first principles mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first question in any new context: "If we were building this today, solely to solve for the generative AI era, what would it look like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We need organizations that operate less like traditional institutions and more like high-performance labs: rigorous, experimental, and deeply interdisciplinary. We need compasses rather than maps. No one has the perfect map for the future of AI, but we can chart it together if we stay curious and focused on human outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I believe the skills that make you good at collaborating with people are the same ones that will make you good at orchestrating AI. The durable skills aren't about any one interface; they're about first principles applied repeatedly until something clicks.
