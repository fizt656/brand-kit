<p>Part 1 reframed the question: the strategic unit is the harness, not the model.</p>
    <p>Part 2 gave us an evaluation lens: Black Swan awareness, antifragility, and skin in the game.</p>
    <p>Now the practical question: <strong>what do we do with that on Monday morning?</strong></p>
    <h2>From adoption theater to value engineering</h2>
    <p>A lot of teams still celebrate the wrong numbers:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>“X% of employees have AI access”</li>
    <li>“Y prompts per week”</li>
    <li>“Z licenses activated”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those metrics are not useless, they’re just incomplete.</p>
    <p>The better shift is from <strong>usage volume</strong> to <strong>value density</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>In which task categories does AI reliably improve cycle time, quality, or decision confidence?</li>
    <li>Where does human review add value, and where is it just friction?</li>
    <li>Which loops are compounding because the harness is learning?</li>
    <li>Which loops are quietly accumulating hidden risk?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the dashboard cannot answer those questions, we don’t have a performance harness yet, we have a tooling footprint.</p>
    <h2>A practical starting sequence</h2>
    <p>If we lead technical teams, product, operations, or strategy, here is a practical path that does not require a giant transformation program:</p>
    <p><strong>Pick three high-value task categories</strong></p>
    <p>   Not broad functions. Specific repeatable tasks: claims triage, protocol drafting, incident summarization, vendor risk memos.</p>
    <p><strong>Define value and risk per task</strong></p>
    <p>   What does better mean here: speed, quality, variance reduction, escalation accuracy? What can fail, and how bad is bad?</p>
    <p><strong>Place humans intentionally</strong></p>
    <p>   Decide where humans initiate, review, approve, or audit only. Do this by risk tier, not by habit.</p>
    <p><strong>Build a sandboxed pilot harness</strong></p>
    <p>   Give models tools, context boundaries, and observation hooks. Keep rollback easy. Instrument what actually matters.</p>
    <p><strong>Iterate quickly, with evidence</strong></p>
    <p>   Weekly cadence, small scope changes, explicit hypotheses. Don’t wait for perfect certainty from outside. Learn in your own environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Recruit harness builders, not just model enthusiasts</strong></p>
    <p>   We need people who can connect model behavior to workflow design, controls, and measurement. That blend is still rare, and it is where leverage is.</p>
    <h2>A quick litmus test</h2>
    <p>Ask this once per workflow:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Are we measuring net value, or just activity?</li>
    <li>Did this loop get safer and faster over the last month?</li>
    <li>Are accountability and authority aligned when things go wrong?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the answer is mostly “not yet,” that is not failure, it is a clear starting point.</p>
    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>The next gap won’t just be between organizations that use AI and organizations that don’t.</p>
    <p>It’ll be between organizations that adopted tools, and organizations that built learning systems.</p>
    <p>One bought capability.</p>
    <p>The other engineered compounding value.</p>
    <p>The model race will keep accelerating. Good.</p>
    <p>But weak harnesses turn model upgrades into diminishing returns. Strong harnesses turn them into multipliers.</p>
    <p>Curious what you’re seeing in the wild:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How much are you investing in harness design versus model selection?</li>
    <li>Where are humans positioned in your loops, and why?</li>
    <li>What failure modes taught you the most?</li>
    <li>What resources or collaborators have actually helped?</li>
    </ul>
