    <h1>Stop Asking “What’s the Best Model?”</h1>
    <h2>Part 1, The strategic unit is the harness</h2>
    <p>A question we get a lot is: <strong>“What’s the best model?”</strong></p>
    <p>At this point, most SOTA models are already more than capable for a wide range of real-world work. So the harder question is no longer raw model capability. It’s whether we’re measuring value in context, with clear task-level outcomes, instead of broad usage metrics that feel good but don’t say much.</p>
    <p>That’s where we think the conversation needs to shift, from the model itself to the <strong>harness</strong> around it.</p>
    <p>By harness, we mean the practical system around a model, tools, environment, workflows, guardrails, human checkpoints, and feedback loops, that determines whether AI produces repeatable value in the setting it actually operates in.</p>
    <p>In recent conversations with peers, we kept seeing the same pattern. Under pressure, everyone naturally compares model benchmarks: latency, evals, context windows, price per token. All useful, but not enough on their own.</p>
    <p>Then someone asked a better question:</p>
    <p><strong>“If we swapped the model tomorrow, what in your workflow would still create the same value? What might improve, and what might drop?”</strong></p>
    <p>That question shifted the conversation fast. Not dramatic, just honest. We are all learning this in real time.</p>
    <p>The takeaway was pretty consistent: many teams still treat model selection as strategy, when it is really one component choice inside a much larger system. The teams seeing durable value are usually not the ones that “picked a winner.” They are the ones building a harness that fits their environment, tasks, and constraints.</p>
    <p>So yes, model quality matters.</p>
    <p>But strategy starts one layer up.</p>
    <h2>What We Mean by “Harness”</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>harness</strong> in a specific way.</p>
    <p>A harness is not just a safety wrapper or a policy document. It is the operational architecture around a model that determines whether capability turns into outcomes.</p>
    <p>At minimum, that includes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tooling layer:</strong> retrieval, APIs, internal systems, execution boundaries</li>
    <li><strong>Environment layer:</strong> permissions, sandboxing, observability, rollback paths</li>
    <li><strong>Human positioning layer:</strong> where people review, intervene, escalate, or delegate</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement layer:</strong> what “good” looks like by task category, and how we track it over time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When people say “human in the loop,” the conversation often stops at governance language. The more useful question is more precise:</p>
    <p><strong>Where is the human in the loop, for which tasks, at which risk thresholds, with what decision rights?</strong></p>
    <p>That is not semantics. It is performance engineering.</p>
    <h2>Why “Human in the Loop” and “Guardrails” Are Necessary, and Still Incomplete</h2>
    <p>To be fair, this framing emerged for good reasons. Teams needed practical language for safety, compliance, accountability, and risk controls. “Human in the loop” and “guardrails” gave us a starting point.</p>
    <p>But when that framing becomes the whole operating model, we usually see two predictable failure modes:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Control-heavy stagnation</strong></p>
    <p>   Everything routes through bottlenecks, pilots drag, and teams conclude “AI is overhyped” when the underlying issue is architecture.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Capability-heavy chaos</strong></p>
    <p>   Teams skip structure, ship brittle systems, then overcorrect with blanket restrictions after the first incident.</p>
    <p>A good harness has to do both jobs at once:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>reduce downside</li>
    <li>preserve and amplify upside</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Too much inhibition, no learning.</p>
    <p>Too much improvisation, no coherence.</p>
    <p>If we’ve ever played in a jazz combo, we know this instinctively: we need a chart, a key center, and shared timing, but we also need room for emergence. Enterprise AI is not that different. Constraints and creativity are co-requirements.</p>
    <p>In neuro terms, we should think less in terms of a single reflex loop and more in terms of a coordinated network: inhibitory control when stakes are high, fast pathways when opportunity is time-sensitive, and plasticity so the system improves from feedback instead of repeating mistakes with better branding.</p>
