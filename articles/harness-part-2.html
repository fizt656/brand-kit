        <p class="article-subtitle">Part II · A Taleb lens for testing whether your AI system holds up</p>
        <div class="article-meta"><a href="../index.html?view=articles">gushalwani.com</a></div>
      </div>
      <div class="article-body">
<p>In Part 1, we argued that model selection is not the strategy.</p>
    <p>The strategy is the harness: the operational system that turns model capability into outcomes in your real environment.</p>
    <p>So the obvious follow-up is: <strong>how do we evaluate a harness without fooling ourselves?</strong></p>
    <p>One useful lens comes from Nassim Taleb’s work. Not as doctrine, and definitely not as intellectual cosplay, just as a practical stress test for real systems under uncertainty.</p>
    <p>The three lenses we keep coming back to are:</p>
    <p><strong>Black Swan awareness</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Antifragility</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Skin in the game</strong></p>
    <p>If a harness is weak on any one of these, performance and trust erode fast in production.</p>
    <h2>1) Black Swan awareness</h2>
    <p><strong>Can we reduce catastrophic downside without killing beneficial surprise?</strong></p>
    <p>Most AI governance conversations over-index on one side:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>either “lock it all down,”</li>
    <li>or “move fast and let the team experiment.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both instincts are understandable. Neither is enough.</p>
    <p>If we optimize only for predictability, we often suppress exactly the rare upside events that make AI worth deploying in the first place: unexpected synthesis, non-obvious retrieval paths, better-than-baseline first drafts, earlier signal detection.</p>
    <p>If we optimize only for novelty, we invite preventable failures, especially where decision stakes are high.</p>
    <p>A strong harness separates <strong>good surprise</strong> from <strong>bad surprise</strong> in practice.</p>
    <p>That means:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>setting clear boundaries for where exploration is allowed</li>
    <li>tightening controls where failure costs are asymmetric</li>
    <li>instrumenting edge cases instead of treating them as embarrassing exceptions</li>
    <li>creating escalation paths that are fast, not bureaucratic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The test is simple: when something unusual happens, do we learn and route it, or panic and freeze?</p>
    <h2>2) Antifragility</h2>
    <p><strong>Does the system improve under stress, or just survive it?</strong></p>
    <p>Many systems are robust at best. They tolerate some turbulence.</p>
    <p>That is fine for static environments, but AI workflows are not static.</p>
    <p>Prompts drift. Data shifts. Teams change. Vendors update silently. New failure modes appear in combinations nobody predicted in planning docs.</p>
    <p>So the question is not “Can this harness avoid failure forever?”</p>
    <p>It is “When failure happens, does the harness get better?”</p>
    <p>Antifragile patterns look like this:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>incidents are logged with enough context to diagnose root causes</li>
    <li>fixes are encoded into system behavior, not just tribal memory</li>
    <li>approval thresholds evolve based on observed risk, not meeting-room anxiety</li>
    <li>human review effort gets redistributed to high-risk zones over time</li>
    <li>prompts, tool routing, and exception handling are versioned and auditable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words: volatility becomes learning fuel.</p>
    <p>If every incident leads to blanket restrictions, your harness is getting more fragile, not safer.</p>
    <h2>3) Skin in the game</h2>
    <p><strong>Are authority and accountability aligned across the people building and running this?</strong></p>
    <p>This one is less technical, more structural, and usually where things break first.</p>
    <p>When one team ships, another team absorbs operational risk, and a third team reports success metrics, even strong technical architecture becomes politically unstable.</p>
    <p>Signs of weak skin in the game:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>adoption KPIs disconnected from quality outcomes</li>
    <li>“pilot success” claims with no downstream ownership</li>
    <li>risk teams brought in late and blamed early</li>
    <li>frontline operators carrying exception burden without design authority</li>
    <li>executive visibility focused on activity volume, not value quality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Strong harnesses align incentives and decision rights:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the people closest to operational failure modes influence design decisions</li>
    <li>success metrics include error costs, rework, and escalation burden</li>
    <li>governance owns tradeoffs, not just approvals</li>
    <li>leaders are accountable for both speed and safety, not one each</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If accountability floats upward while consequences flow downward, the system will look good on slides and crack in production.</p>
